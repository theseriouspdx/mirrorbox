# CHANGELOG.md
## Mirror Box Orchestrator — Project Evolution

---

### [0.7.1] — 2026-03-09
#### Added
- **DID Qualitative Consensus (0.7-01):** Formally updated `SPEC.md` to redefine consensus from "Checksum Parity" to "Qualitative Intent."
- **ExecutionPlan Schema:** Added `intent`, `stateTransitions`, and `invariantsPreserved` to the formal contract (Section 13).
- **Stage 1.5 Human Intervention Gate:** Introduced mandatory pause for human context pinning/exclusion before planning begins (Section 15).
- **Consensus Metrics:** Redefined Stage 3C and 4C to prioritize architectural convergence and project invariants over literal file-list matching.

### [0.6.5] — 2026-03-09
#### Added
- **Session Handoff Persistence (0.6-04):** Refactored `scripts/mbo-session-close.sh` to automatically generate `NEXT_SESSION.md`.
- **Handoff Automation:** Script now captures last task ID, name, status, and uses `projecttracking.md` to intelligently detect the next action for the next session.
- **Security Compliance:** Removed all `nhash` persistence from handoff files to comply with `AGENTS.md` Section 8.1 (Secrecy of State).
- **Integrity Tracking:** Handoff now explicitly records database backup SHA-256 and `PRAGMA integrity_check` results.

### [0.6.4] — 2026-03-09
#### Fixed (Audit PASS)
- **BUG-038: JavaScript Graph Enrichment**: Implemented static fallback for import resolution in `src/graph/static-scanner.js`.
- **Placeholder ID Collision**: Fixed bug where relative imports across different files collided in the Intelligence Graph. Placeholder IDs for relative paths are now unique per source file.
- **`src/graph/static-scanner.js`**: Refactored `enrich()` to correctly group placeholders by all importing files and properly trigger `staticEnrich()` when no LSP is detected for a language.

### [0.6-audit] — 2026-03-09
#### Audit
- **Milestone 0.6 audit** run against full task set (0.6-00 through 0.6-03).
- Initial verdict: FAIL (Critical: `operator` role undefined; High: heuristic fallback unreachable).
- Both blocking fixes confirmed applied from prior session. Re-audit verdict: PASS_WITH_CONDITIONS.
- DID reconciliation with Codex: agreed on `operator` role fix; Stage 5 gate / world_id / pre-mutation checkpoint deferred to 0.7/0.8 as out-of-scope for 0.6.
#### Filed
- **BUG-042 (P2):** `graphSummary` truncation branch unreachable — field never populated.
- **BUG-043 (P2):** PID file not written for default agent name `operator` in `mbo-start.sh`.
- Audit artifacts: `.dev/audit/0.6_20260309_ClaudeCode/`

### [0.6.3] — 2026-03-09
#### Fixed
- **`src/graph/mcp-server.js`**: `graph_query_impact` now calls `getGraphQueryResult()` instead of `getImpact()`. Was returning raw edge rows `{id, relation, source}` instead of the `GraphQueryResult` contract `{subsystems, affectedFiles, callers, callees, coveringTests, dependencyChain}`. Agents were getting useless results and falling back to full SPEC.md load.
#### Changed
- **`AGENTS.md` Section 1.5**: Stripped to 3 lines. Removed manual PID verification instructions, agent identity tables, and client config tables that were causing agents to re-run MCP startup manually.
- **`AGENTS.md` Section 11**: Rewrote with absolute DB paths, explicit MCP tool name table, and auto-start confirmation table. Removed relative paths and ambiguous references Flash was misreading.
- **`letsgo.md` Gate 0**: Changed from "use graph tools to find relevant sections" to "run the exact queries listed in NEXT_SESSION.md Section 1." Eliminates exploratory search at session start.
- **`NEXT_SESSION.md` Section 1**: Now includes explicit graph queries for the next task. Agent runs those four queries and stops — no derivation required.
- **`.gemini/settings.json`**: Created at project root. Gemini MCP now auto-starts via project-level config, same as Claude's `.mcp.json`. Fixed command format (`"bash"` + absolute path args, not combined string).
- **`.mcp.json`**: Added `trust: true` to match Gemini config.
#### Filed
- **BUG-037 (P2)**: MCP lifecycle owned by CLI client configs, not orchestrator. Gate 0 `startCommand` should own this. Deferred to Milestone 0.9.

### [0.6.2] — 2026-03-09
#### Added
- **Tier 3 DID (Claude wins reconciliation)**: Background MCP process isolation via PID files.
  - `scripts/mbo-start.sh`: Added `--agent=<claude|gemini>` flag; writes `$$` to `.dev/run/{agent}.pid` before `exec` so PID file targets the node process exactly.
  - `scripts/mbo-session-close.sh`: Added `--terminate-mcp --agent=<name>` branch; SIGTERM → 5s grace → SIGKILL; stale PID detection and cleanup.
  - `AGENTS.md §1.5`: Mandates background start with `--agent`; PID verification step; agent identity table; updated client config table.
  - `AGENTS.md §6C`: Added step 2 — terminate MCP via `mbo-session-close.sh --terminate-mcp`; renumbered steps.
  - `BUGS.md`: Filed BUG-036 (P2) — `mcp-server.js` `shutdown()` missing WAL checkpoint before `process.exit(0)`.

### [0.6.1] — 2026-03-09
#### Added
- **0.6-01**: Operator & Session Manager implemented (`src/auth/operator.js`).
  - Fixed `sendMCPRequest` timeout leak (`clearTimeout` on resolve and reject).
  - Added `getSafelist()` + `_fileExists()` for Tier 0 gate enforcement (safelist membership + physical file existence).
  - Added `confidence < 0.6` clarifying question gate in `classifyRequest`.
  - `summarizeSession` live via `callModel`; placeholder guard; replaces session history; logs `[CONTEXT RESET]`.
  - `getGraphCompleteness()` queries `edges WHERE source = 'runtime'` — no longer hardcodes `'skeleton'` for runtime.
  - `processMessage` logs classification + routing to event store before state snapshot.
- **`src/index.js`**: Operator initialized, MCP started, stdin REPL loop, clean shutdown on close.

### [0.6.0] — 2026-03-09
#### Added
- **0.6-00**: Universal MCP Session Start (DID-validated, Claude + Gemini reconciled).
  - Created `scripts/mbo-start.sh`: vendor-agnostic MCP loader for Claude CLI, Gemini CLI, Python orchestrators.
  - All status output routed to stderr; stdout reserved strictly for JSON-RPC.
  - Dynamic `DB_PATH` resolution via `--mode=dev` / `--mode=runtime` flags.
  - `PRAGMA integrity_check` + `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` on every launch for integrity and stale WAL recovery.
  - Added `--check` passthrough (early-exit for check-only mode is P2 follow-on).
- **AGENTS.md Section 1.5**: Mandates `mbo-start.sh` as source of truth for MCP lifecycle for all future agents and vendors.

---

### [0.5.1] — 2026-03-09
#### Added
- **Invariant 11 Enforcement**: Updated `src/auth/call-model.js` with a hard blockade against proprietary search tools (`grep`, `codebase_investigator`).
- **Tool Agnosticism**: Mandated the use of MBO MCP tools for all codebase discovery operations.
#### Fixed
- **Milestone 0.6.0 Investigation**: Confirmed "Operator" is currently unimplemented and mapped the integration path in `src/auth/call-model.js`.

---

  - Updated `enrich` logic to use both line and column for precise LSP symbol matching, preventing same-line collisions.
  - Implemented **Stale Symbol Purge** (Adversarial Finding #5): `scanFile` now purges all existing nodes/edges owned by a file before re-scanning.
  - Exposed `graph_update_task` MCP tool for incremental graph updates after task completion.
- **0.4B-05**: No-LSP Fallback and Robustness.
  - Implemented **Robust Warmup** (Adversarial Finding #1): Added 3-attempt retry loop with 500ms backoff for LSP requests during indexing.
  - Implemented graceful detection and user notification for missing LSP servers.
  - Implemented global process registry in `LSPClient` to prevent orphan child servers.
  - Added `SIGTERM` and `uncaughtException` handlers to `mcp-server.js`.
#### Changed
- **GraphStore**: Fixed Invariant 7 (Adversarial Finding #3) — `upsertEdge` now prevents `static` scan from overwriting `runtime` source.
- **GraphStore**: Improved `getGraphQueryResult` subsystem heuristic and ID formatting for Section 13 compliance.
- **DBManager**: Added virtual columns and index (`idx_nodes_coords`) for coordinate-based symbol lookups.
- **Dependencies**: Added `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to `package.json`.

  - Integrated `LSPClient` auto-detection for TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python.
- **Dependencies**: Added `vscode-jsonrpc` and `vscode-languageserver-protocol` to `package.json`.
#### Fixed
- **BUG-033**: Enforced ephemeral `LSPClient` instances to prevent task-boundary coupling.

*Last updated: 2026-03-09*

## [0.6.0-prep] - 2026-03-09
### Added
- Pre-0.6 Adversarial Audit PASS.
- mirrorbox.db schema migration and LSP coordinate verification.
- src/auth/call-model.js: event store logging for prompt/response.
- scripts/mbo-session-close.sh: atomic backup and integrity check.
### Fixed
- src/auth/model-router.js: repaired syntax error in routing logic.
- src/auth/call-model.js: strengthened injection heuristic check.

### [preflight-compiled] — 2026-03-09
#### Added
- **`.dev/reports/archive/preflight-did-compiled.md`**: Permanent compiled record of the
  pre-build DID analysis (Claude + Gemini independent runs + tiebreaker). Summarizes all
  confirmed blockers, key divergences, off-the-shelf audit consensus, dangerous spec
  assumptions, and resolution status for each finding.
#### Changed
- **`.dev/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md`**: Removed preflight experiment references. Session
  handoff now points cleanly at Task 0.6-02 as the active work. Preflight phase closed.


### [experiment-compiled] — 2026-03-09
#### Added
- **`.dev/reports/archive/experiment-compiled-results.md`**: Compiled results of the context
  loading experiment suite (E1, E2, E2B, E6 complete; E3/E4/E5 deferred). Key finding:
  graph-driven loading achieves 12–44x token reduction. MCP must be live at session start
  for autonomous querying. Gate 0 bottleneck identified and fixed.
